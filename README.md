# Vocoder Project

Repository for the final project of _[GCT535 Spring 2022 Sound Technology for Multimedia, KAIST](https://mac.kaist.ac.kr/~juhan/gct535/index.html)_.

We constructed our own **Vocoder Effect and related parameters to mimick several iconic vocoder-effected vocal tracks** which are Daftpunk, Zedd and Stevie Wonder.

- First, we implemented a classic channel vocoder using band-pass filters and RMS filters.

- Second, we implemented and compared controllable parameters including F0, Number of Frequency Bands, Frequency Scale, Random Noising, Formant Shifting and Beta between modulator and carrier. We also implemented compressor and expander to improve the effector sound.

- Finally, we mimicked the target artists using our implemented vocoder and its parameters.
  We also generated interesting results with various types of carrier sounds.

You can check the result samples and detail on our [demo page](https://yoonjinxd.github.io/vocoder_demo/).
